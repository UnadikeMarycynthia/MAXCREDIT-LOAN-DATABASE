MaxCredit Loan Database Performance Analysis

Project Overview

The MaxCredit Loan Database Performance Analysis project provides a comprehensive assessment of factors influencing loan amounts, borrower profiles, and overall credit trends. This project aims to offer data-driven insights into loan distribution patterns, customer segmentation, and financial risk management. It highlights the critical role of credit scores, age, home ownership status, education levels, and past credit behaviors in determining loan eligibility and amounts.

Objective

To identify and visualize the key drivers behind loan amounts to improve lending strategies, enhance customer targeting, and optimize financial risk assessments.

Key Data Insights

1. Credit Score and Loan Amount

Credit scores play a crucial role in determining loan eligibility and amounts.

Borrowers with a credit score of 652 received the highest total funding, amounting to $3.91M, suggesting a potential sweet spot for lenders.

In contrast, borrowers with a credit score of 658 received the lowest total funding at $3.84M, indicating the importance of precise credit assessments.

2. Age Distribution and Loan Amount

Younger borrowers (20-24) received the highest average loan amount at $2,301, possibly reflecting their longer earning potential.

Loan amounts decline sharply with age, with borrowers aged 50-54 receiving the least average funding at $26, indicating a risk-averse approach by lenders.

3. Home Ownership Status

Mortgage holders secured the highest average loan amount at $3,521, reflecting their established financial stability and lower perceived risk.

Renters, on the other hand, received significantly lower funding at $464, highlighting the role of asset ownership in credit evaluations.

4. Previous Loan Defaults

Borrowers without prior defaults received higher average loan amounts ($3,493), indicating a preference for low-risk customers.

Those with previous defaults received lower average amounts ($2,795), reflecting the impact of credit history on lending decisions.

5. Gender and Interest Rate Distribution

Males received a higher average loan amount ($273,659) compared to females ($221,638), potentially reflecting broader income disparities or risk assessments.

6. Best Loan Intentions

Education remains the top funding category, accounting for $711.78M in total loans, followed closely by venture ($645.63M) and medical expenses ($627.55M), emphasizing the long-term financial value of education.

7. Income by Education Level
